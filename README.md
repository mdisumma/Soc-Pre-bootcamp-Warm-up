# Pre-bootcamp Warm-up

Your mission is to take a website and copy it’s home page. This will keep your core HTML and CSS skills sharp. The way you plan and build the web page will keep your command line, git and planning skills sharp. Once you’ve completed the project you will study some best practice guides and review your code - identifying and fixing at least five issues.

Half of the value is in the planning and how you work - it is not just about just replicating a page. Don’t forget this.


## Deliverables:

- A web page that looks like the web page we’ve asked you to copy.
- A project board that shows really good planning.
- A clean commit history.
